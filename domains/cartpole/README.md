# CartPole Domain

The novelty level 0 CartPole task is for the agent to move a cart left and
right in order to keep an attached pole balanced. The agent receives sensor
data about the time, the position and velocity of the cart, and the angle and
angular velocity of the pole. The agent also receives feedback about their
current performance. The possible actions are move left and move right. The
cart and pole have different starting positions each episode. An episode ends
if the cart moves too far left or right, the pole falls, or a time limit is
exceeded.
