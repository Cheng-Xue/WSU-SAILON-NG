# VizDoom Domain

The novelty level 0 VizDoom task is for the agent (player) to shoot a
stationary enemy. The agent receives sensor data about the time, the player
health and position, and the enemy health and position. The agent also receives
feedback about their current performance. The possible actions are move left,
move right, and shoot.  The player and enemy have random starting positions
each episode. An episode ends when either the enemy dies, the player dies, or a
time limit is exceeded.
